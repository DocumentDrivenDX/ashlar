# Accept original schema through Truss

`accept-schema.py` is a concrete existing-installation example using the public
Python APIs at Truss commit `559f3cda1566685c106b6f1b8a16d157b617cb4b`.
It prepares original UMF bytes through Truss's bundled Bun producer, accepts them
in a caller-owned transaction, commits, then reads the actual report and complete
catalog in a new transaction. No schema conversion or fabricated IDs are used.

Prerequisites: installed Ashlar and that Truss Python package, Python 3.11+,
psycopg/psycopg-binary 3.3.6 with libpq 18.6, PostgreSQL 18.6, and the Bun version
selected by Truss's bundled producer. This version tuple follows Truss's public
`packages/python/README.md`; this example has not run a native database check.

An administrator must already have installed the **compatible current Truss
catalog runtime**, committed it, and granted its registrar role to your ordinary
login. Select that existing database directly, with `SET ROLE` left `none`.
The example does not provision roles, create an installation, or migrate an older
Truss runtime. The selected documents must be supported by Truss's current catalog
profile. Preparation does not imply acceptance; unsupported content can refuse.

Create an operator-private JSON file (for example mode 0600):

```json
{
  "connection_uri": "postgresql://your-user:YOUR-PASSWORD@localhost:5432/your-database",
  "bun": "/absolute/path/to/bun",
  "documents": [
    {
      "path": "/absolute/path/to/original.umf.json",
      "document_id": "your-original-document-id",
      "document_revision": "1"
    }
  ],
  "request_key": "accept-your-schema-v1",
  "origin_path": "/absolute/path/to/original-origin.json"
}
```

IDs/revisions are your original document selections, not generated catalog IDs.
Origin is the exact caller-selected JSON bytes, separate from authenticated actor.
Use original documents without rewriting unknown extensions. This example bounds
configuration/origin to 64 KiB and each of 1–16 documents to 1 MiB; Truss applies
its own preparation and semantic limits.

```sh
python examples/truss-native/accept-schema.py \
  --configuration /absolute/path/to/private-config.json \
  --output /absolute/path/to/fresh-accepted-catalog.json
```

The fresh report is written only after transactions, assembly admission, host
attachment and connection cleanup. It contains the actual registration ID,
revision and replay flag, plus **original complete report and catalog JSON bytes
as Base64** (`report_original_base64`, `catalog_original_base64`), preserving
unknown fields without reconstruction. Decode those fields to inspect accepted
native IDs and definitions. Credentials are never printed by this script.

Failure does not automatically retry or roll back a commit that already
succeeded. A network error during commit can leave the outcome unknown; inspect
Truss's durable registration/report using the same original request before
choosing a retry. A post-commit report/cleanup failure likewise does not undo the
schema acceptance. This example qualifies no mutation, import, feed, source ACK,
query compilation or cross-engine schema correspondence.
